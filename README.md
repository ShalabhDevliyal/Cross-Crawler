# Cross-Crawler




To create a step-by-step guide for running your XSS Crawler tool, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

2. **Install the required libraries**: You will need the `scrapy` and `tkinter` libraries. You can install them using pip:

   ```
   pip install scrapy
   pip install tk
   ```

3. **Clone the XSS Crawler repository**: Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ShalabhDevliyal/XSS-Crawler.git
   ```

4. **Run the XSS Crawler**: Navigate to the cloned repository and run the following command:

   ```
   python xss_crawler.py
   ```

   This will open the GUI, where you can enter the domain to crawl and start the crawl.

5. **View the results**: Once the crawl is complete, you will see the results in the terminal, displaying the URLs and their XSS vulnerability status.
